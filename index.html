<h1>Site of Broke Consortium Delegacy</h1>
</center>
<p>Welcome to Broke Consortium!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Broke Consortium turned into existence on 21 May, 2023, yet did not operate until any accession of school was found. The consortium was planned to release after the Bumping Series Consortium was closed in 
its acceding territory; Beaconhouse Satellite Town, Rawalpindi, Boys. The reason of primary failure was its zero recognition and classified research contrary to B-Consortium promising to cooperate with the 
allies and keep all its research positively open to allies, yet keeping protocols still effective to disclose them here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Broke Consortium, found from ancestor BS Consortium has arranged not to offer any coalitions and quo situations with any partners of BSTR-B regardless of whether they have a place with a school that 
consented Broke Consortium. Sir Nisar Ali of BSTR-B, BMI-G had cordial relations with BS Consortium, and the consortium does uphold the same standards of respect for him; the method implied is not hateful 
to any affiliate from that school; but won't give any alliance status to anyone.</p>
 
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>AI</p>
